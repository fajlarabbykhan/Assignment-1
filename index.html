            <p>Most of the web developers go through all the above phases and initially it might be frustrating for some
                of them, but the overall feeling is really exciting and amazing when they see their website is live and
                people are using it all over the world. A web developer is responsible for so many tasks from gathering
                requirements to designing a website, handling its backend part, and also making it live successfully for
                users. </p>
